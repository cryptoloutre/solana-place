# SolanaPlace Frontend

SolanaPlace is an onchain pixel war between crypto communities. 

Set your own rules: paint the color of your choice one pixel at a time, create designs, defend your own, or paint over the designs of others!

Plays 15 pixels and gets a commemorative NFT.

This event aims to make people test Solana and to onboard new people in a fun way.
